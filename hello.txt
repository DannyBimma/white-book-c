The "Hello, world" Program
The first exercise to be completed in the book is the obligatory
"Hello world." The text doesn't dive too deep, sticking mostly to
using it as opposed to how it works under the hood.

So as per the exercise, I wrote a "Hello, world" in C with a little
flare. It uses the escape characters for new line (\n) and tab (\t)
to make a sort of double-spaced output for the world's most popular
program.
